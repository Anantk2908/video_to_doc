      " This is Inuyama, Japan, a historic city home to Japan's oldest original wooden castle. It is also home to Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute. Here, a group of chimpanzees have been trained to play a game that exposes something shocking about their memories. This is going to blow your mind. Here is how it works. Take a look at these numbers. One, two, three. Remember where they are because they're about to disappear. Can you point to where each number used to be in numerical order? Probably it's pretty easy. One, two, three. But what if we make it harder? Get ready to point to where each number was in order now. If you feel like you didn't have enough time to memorize the screen, that's fine. It's nothing to be ashamed of. Or is it? Here is a chimpanzee taking exactly that long to memorize the same arrangement. Now that. Each of these puzzles is completely new to the chimpanzee, but just a glance is all it needs to completely capture all the numbers. How can a chimpanzee's memory be so much better than ours? Well, one theory is that we humans are worse at this task because we can talk. What makes humans different from other animals? Well, one thing is language. We have the cognitive ability to communicate not just about what's happening now, but also about what did happen. And what could happen? We can tell stories. And it's awesome. But if language is so good, why didn't any other animal develop it like we did? A good approach to this question is one that looks at how we are different from those who were almost us. Around seven million years ago, there were no chimpanzees and there were no humans, but there were chulcus, an acronym which stands for chimpanzee human. Chimpanzee human, last common ancestor. Like us, chulcus didn't have great natural offenses or defenses like flistering sprint speeds, protective shells or claws, fangs or venom. So, living in the safety of the trees was great. Those who stayed became the chimps we know today. But for reasons we're still not quite sure of, some of the chulcus decided to venture down to the Savannah. Without appropriate physical abilities, things like collaboration, imagining new strategies and the assigning of roles were necessary for survival. All of which are easier if you have a rich collection of symbols that can refer to things across time. Language. Many different types of creatures emerged with varying adaptations, but today only one member of the family remains us. Language as we know it may have been one of the strategies that kept us alive in the Savannah. But where did it move in? The brains of those who developed language and those who didn't aren't totally different. A brand new brain structure didn't just pop into existence. Instead, anatomy used for other tasks must have been sacrificed. And as it turns out, for beautiful reasons, detailed short-term memory may have been a fair thing to lose in return for language. This tradeoff between memory and language is the cognitive tradeoff hypothesis. The cognitive tradeoff hypothesis is the culmination of decades of work by one of the world's leading primatologists, Professor Tetsuro Matsuzawa of Kyoto University's Primate Research Institute. Founded in 1967, the Institute was created for scientific research in association with the nearby Japan Monkeys Center. The collaborative centers housed over 60 species and nearly 1,000 primates who live and play in open spaces. Look at the Monkeys. Look at Spiderman Key. Is there a baby on that one? Yes, yes, yes, yes, six months old baby. Six months. Showing the monkeys and the apes in the three. Yeah, in the three. That is a key because they live. That's where they live. In the natural habitat. Can you do it? Dr. Matsuzawa has spent over 40 years researching non-human primates. He splits his time between fieldwork and the West African country of Guinea and here in Japan, where he and his colleagues have developed a chimpanzee habitat designed to mimic life in the wild. This habitat is home to Skylab, a working laboratory set high atop the chimpanzees climbing structure. In this open air lab, chimpanzees are free to come and go as they please. And this is Hayo. If they decide to stay, they participate in cognitively enriching tasks designed to mimic foraging behavior. When the chimpanzees are interested in participating, they enter one of Skylab's specially designed computer boots, where a camera uses facial recognition software to recognize them and select a test based on that particular chimps current familiarity with the task. Each trial takes about as long as it would for a chimpto forage a single bite. And each morsel of food they get is accounted for in their diet. Do the doors open when they approach? No human even needs to be... No, nothing. So what is for us a great way to collect data is for them, an experienced similar in many ways to what they would be doing in the wild. There you go. Impressive. Dr. Matsu Zawa has been running memory tests like these on chimpanzees since 1978. His research has shown the phenomenal and nearly photographic short-term memory of these primates. Two of the most famous chimps at the PRI are eye named after the Japanese word for love and her son, Ayumu, whose name means walk. What can we learn about ourselves by studying chimpanzees like them? Well, I want to find out. If we in chimpanzees come from a common ancestor, what can explain the split where the chimpanzees don't seem to need or to develop language like we do. Why would that happen? Was it an accident? The bear is evidence tells us chimpanzees was so strong and continued to stay in the forest. We humans were not so strong. We were kicked out from the forest. Aha! And coming down to the ground to go into the dangerous open land where lions cheaters and zooms. Those carnivorous creatures we protect ourselves from the predator. Our habitat provided a pressure to develop language. Yes, we have to collaborate each other. So as a group, that's incredible. So in a way, we should be really grateful that our ancestors were so weak they got pushed out of the trees. We have succeeded to show extraordinarily memory capability of chimpanzees. He is protesting, but I didn't buy you to be part of this interview, but you don't have language. He doesn't need to have the language. So she has the mainly living in the world of here right now. You have to put something happening in the bush. You have to count up one, two, three, four, five. How many enemies here to make a quick decision to go into the territory or lead lead? So that is the life of chimpanzees. Quick decision. Our ancestors didn't have that same pressure in the course of human evolution. We may have had this kind of capability, but we lost it to gain the new function, the language. Maybe memory and the language, the very rudimental form, was located in the neighboring parts of the brain. So to expand one area, another one must be shrunk. So putting all those things together to postulate my trade-up hypothesis of language and memory. The cognitive trade-up hypothesis suggests that in the dangerous world beyond the trees, early humans needed to teach each other and use abstract symbols that could refer not just to the immediate here and now, but to hypotheticals and generalities. Making room for that kind of abstract thinking meant sacrificing the immediate and detailed memory of their ancestors. I can think about the future of my child and their children. Yeah, chimpanzee do not have this kind of planning of the future. So the defiles in one word is imagination. I'm able to imagine past and future. I'm able to describe things in an abstract way and I don't need the details because I have the label. So it seems like a pretty good trade-off. Yes. But how do we use the Paul V. Imagination? Is foresharing. Helping each other, collaborating each other to raise the children. Yeah. I understand chimpanzee mind. So that now I understand the unique feature of human mind and that is sharing. What a great message. Reng sharing is what makes us us. Yes. Sharing is the matter. I would love to see your working memory test on chimpanzees in action. I would also really love to participate myself and see how well I can do. Compared to chimpanzee. Yes. Have you ever had a human and a chimpanzee compete like that together? No, not really. So you are the real person. I think they're excited about the idea too. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. You're so cute. Today it will be Celebrity Chimped Eye. Eye is older now and just like in humans, her cognitive abilities have decreased with time. So I may actually stand a chance. So why don't you try? To face off against eye, I will be sitting in the booth next to her. Now normally, for Sun Eye, you move place against her. But today, well, she's in for some Michael time. I'm not your child though, am I? The tests are going to get harder as we go along. How will my memory compare to that of a chim who never made the same cognitive trade-off? In the first round, the task is to remember where each of the three numbers are in numerical order. But here's the trick. As soon as I touch one of them on the screen, the other two will be covered by solid squares. So I can no longer see where they are. Now, well, it's up to my memory. Okay, let's go. If I make a mistake, I get an error noise like this. While a correct answer sounds like this. When the chim pansy gets it right, they are rewarded with apples. The human, me, just gets the braviness. Getting apples. You really actually have to focus more than I expected. I'll always mess that one up. Finished. I, 90 percent. How did Michael do? 95. 95. Be the interesting. On my first run, I've managed to be I. So the next one is slightly more difficult. What is the next task? How many symbols? No explanation because no explanation to I. No explanation to Michael. Get set to go. Whoa. This is a lot harder. This game is similar to the last, but starts a little bit differently. This time, three numbers appear on a blank screen, but as soon as I touch the first one, the entire screen is covered in boxes. Did you forget to choose who you are? When you cover them, would you call them? And then? You know what's the difference with what the player possesses in following your kinds of media name, you normally un Polluted bars then. You're the one with a card. This man's number to buy a. Wow. What is he? Michael. I Yeah, my fun She's nervous she cannot do baby well, so she got upset to you I is used to Iuma her son playing the game beside her so my presence may be throwing her off I'm here for moral support. I It was fun squaring off against I but I want to see how I would do against her son. Iuma So would you like to try Iuma's kind of memory test? I'm ready. Okay Iumu is currently Matsuzawa's best pupil able to ace the memory tests at lazily fast speeds But today Iumu is not interested in mental combat. He's busy flirting with some young ladies who live with him here at the PRR And since free choice is the guiding principle of Matsuzawa's research We can't make him join us. The good news is that Iuma doesn't need to be here for me to compete against him The game can be presented to me just as Iumu does it with nine new ones Let's see if my luck is the same against Iumu as it was against I Ready get set to go oh Man you may take a time as long as You want okay to remember nine new models Wow He's not even when I take time. I can't do it right right even you believe that you remember Actually not take more time. Okay more time Thought I had that one It takes a long time to memorize nine numerals positions and Fail it's embarrassing how long this takes me I Can do this one You Talk to All right, could you come here please yeah You took a long long time Many seconds or you don't need to laugh about it 16.9 7.1 7.0 13.7 0.0 2.9 Getting better yeah, because you were you're a pressure You know it's 0.5 second So you always 2.3456 times worse six times slower So Would you like to try Iuma speed yeah, I would love to okay. Okay. Okay This is the most difficult test So are you mochimpansy mode? I have to remember all nine numbers In numerical order at I move speed which is to say I have to do what I could barely do before But now I have to memorize them all within the amount of time it takes to blink So to point five seconds So I get half a second to prepare and It's impossible. I'm gonna prove you're on As a reminder this is how Iuma performance which is standard for a young chim Okay, let's go You gotta be kidding me. That's way too fast. I got the first three good boy It's like a joke Hodge I don't know where the two is It's too fast Trying to think of this very holistically After the first three if I see them I'm just having to guess So you let cognites that you cannot do just like a you it's impossible. Yeah, it's impossible What happens was helpful for you It was the first time you had had a chimpanzee in a human together in the booth. Yes, what do you think fantastic? It was so interesting. Oh, you chimpanzee and Michael If you ever need me the study as a prime artist I give myself to you Not many people recognize a history of studying chimpanzees very short In the world only 60 years wow a chimpanzees about 50 60 years So this means we need the patience chimpanzees are classified endangered species so to pass those treasure to the next generation Now we have to do the action We need more information from chimpanzees to continue the research to know more about the chimpanzees They are evolutionary neighbors cousins so they're composing up different species Let us know the evolutionary origins of many kinds of human traits We need to make sure to preserve them right? Conservation they're already endangered and yet they are our closest link to understanding what we came from And where we might go It's like taking care of your family. Mm right quite literally. Yes My home is you please a message to the people what you have written as but you have experienced Zart is human because a key word is sharing The fact that humans alone use complex symbolic language doesn't make us any better than any other species It just means that the path we took required it in fact in some ways we aren't better because we can talk Today we study those who took different paths as a way to learn more about ourselves If we lose them we lose part of our story where we came from who we are and who we can be in the future And as always thanks for watching this season on mind field I will die but should I I want to perform a reverse exercise There was a good glowing figure man I would love to do the Stanford prison experiment again There it looks last them again number three Have you ever had a human in a chimpanzee compete like that together in a fun Whoa I'm going to make my hometown function like a brain Doing a good moral deed can actually make you more likely to do something immoral We're going to see if we can get people to allow a child to take the blame for a crime they committed How do you son 12 We're gonna get this out to the police This facility is where you both cryoprizer people and store them we have 159 patients in these tanks We're offering an unknown extension of human life span You spied on their dream. Yeah, that's pretty spooky We received a message from outer space Please figure out what this message is saying. You ready? I'm ready Hey, I have to leave and go over to the next episode, but you can come with me click below to check out the next episode of mine field I'll see you there\n"

       "{'text': \" Humans rule Earth without competition. But we're about to create something that may change that. Our last invention, the most powerful tool, weapon, or maybe even entity, artificial super intelligence. This sounds like science fiction. So let's start at the beginning. Intelligence is the ability to learn, reason, acquire knowledge and skills, and use them to solve problems. Intelligence is power and with the species that exploited it the most. So much so that humanity broke the game of nature and took control. But the journey there wasn't straightforward. For most animals, intelligence costs too much energy to be worth it. Still, if we track intelligence in the tree of species over time, we can see lots of diverse forms of intelligence emerge. The earliest brains were in flat worms 500 million years ago. Just a tiny cluster of neurons to handle basic body functions. It took hundreds of millions of years for species to diversify and become more complex. Life, Concord, New Environment, gained new senses and had to contend with fierce competition over resources. But in nature, all that matters is survival and brains are expensive, so for almost all animals, a narrow intelligence fit for a narrow range of tasks was enough. In some environments, animals like birds, altruuses and mammals evolved more complex neural structures. For them, it paid off to have more energy consuming skills like advanced navigation and communication. Until 7 billion years ago, the hominins emerged. We don't know why, but their brains grew faster than their relatives. Something was different about their intelligence. Very slowly, it turned from narrow to general, from a screwdriver to a multitool, able to think about diverse problems. Two million years ago, homoretta saw the world differently from anyone before, as something to be understood and transformed. They controlled fire, invented tools, and created the first culture. We probably emerged from them around 250,000 years ago, with an even larger and more complex brain. It enabled us to work together in large groups and to communicate complex thoughts. We used our intelligence to improve our lives, to ask how things work, and why things are the way they are. With each discovery, we asked more questions and pushed forward, preserving what we learned, outpacing what evolution could do with genes. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Progress was slower first and then sped up exponentially. Agriculture, writing medicine, astronomy, or philosophy exploded into the world. 200 years ago, science took off and made us even better at learning about the world and speeding up progress. 35 years ago, the internet age began. Today, we live in a world made to suit our needs, created by us, for us. This is incredibly new. We forget how hard it was to get here. How enormous the steps on the intelligence ladder were, and how long it took to climb them. But once we did, we became the most powerful animal in the world in a heartbeat. But we may be in the process of changing this. We're building machines that could be better at the very thing that gave us the power to conquer the planet. Humanity's final invention. Artificial intelligence. Artificial intelligence, or AI, is software that performs mental tasks with a computer. Code that uses silicon instead of neurons to solve problems. In the beginning, AI was very simple. Lines of code on paper may have proofs of concept to demonstrate how machines could perform mental tasks. Only in the 1960s, to be start seeing the first examples of what we would recognise as AI. The chatbot in 1964, the program to saw three molecules in 1965. Slow, specialized systems requiring experts to use them. Their intelligence was extremely narrow, built for a single task inside a controlled environment. The equivalent of flat worms 500 million years ago, doing the minimum amount of mental work. Progress in AI research paused several times when researchers lost hope in the technology. But just like changing environments creating new niches for life, the world around AI changed. Between 1950 and 2000, computers got a billion times faster while programming became easier and widespread. In 1972, AI could navigate a room. In 1989, it could read handwritten numbers. But it remained a fancy tool, no match for humans. Until in 1997, an AI shocked the world by beating the world champion in chess. Proving that we could build machines that could surpass us, but we can't ourselves because a chess bot is quite stupid, not a flat worm, but maybe a bee, only able to perform a specialized narrow task. But within this narrow task, it's so good that no human will ever again be an AI at chess. As computers continued to improve, AI became a powerful tool for more and more tasks. In 2004, it drove a robot on Mars in 2011, it began recommending YouTube videos to you. But this was only possible because humans broke down problems into easy to digest chunks that computers could solve quickly. Until we told AI to teach themselves. Rise of the self-learning machines. This is not a technical video, so we're massively oversimplifying here. In a nutshell, the sheer power of supercomputers was combined with the almost-to-end-the-state-aclected and-need information age to make a new generation of AI. AI experts began drastically improving forms of AI software called neural networks. Inormously huge networks of artificial neurons that start out being bad at their tasks. They then used machine learning, which is an umbrella term for many different training techniques and environments that allow to algorithms to write their own code and improve themselves. The scary thing is that we don't exactly know how they do it and what happens inside them, just that it works and that what comes out the other end is a new type of AI. A capable black box of code. These new AI's could master complex skills extremely quickly with much less human help. They were still narrow in tolerances, but a huge step up. In 2014, Facebook AI could identify faces with 97% accuracy. In 2016, an AI beat the best humans in the incredibly complex game of go. In 2018, a self-learning AI learned chess in four hours just by playing against itself and then defeated the best specialized chess button. Since then, machine learning has been applied to reading, image processing, solving tests and much more. Many of these AI's are already better than humans for whatever narrow task they were trained, but they still remain a simple tool. AI still didn't seem that big of a deal for most people. And then came the chatbot chatGPT. The work that went into it is massive. It trained on any everything written on the internet to learn how to handle language, which it now does better than most people. It can summarise, translate and help with some math problems. It's incredibly more broad than any other system just a few years ago, not crushing any single benchmark, but all of them are once. Many large tech companies are spending billions to build powerful competitors. AI is already transforming customer service, banking, healthcare, marketing, copywriting, creative spaces and more. AI generated content has already taken hold of social media, YouTube and news websites. Elections are expected to be inundated by propaganda and misinformation. No one is sure how much good or harm can come from adopting AI everywhere. Changes scary, there will be winners and losers. One of the biggest questions governments and corporations have now is how to manage the transition to an AI booster economy. All these potential gains or risks are just the result of today's AI. ChatGPT's intelligence is a major step up, but it remains narrow. One it can write a great essay in seconds, it doesn't understand what it's writing. But what if the AI's stopped being narrow? General AI. What makes humans different from current AI is our general intelligence. Humans can technically absorb any piece of knowledge and start working on any problem. We're great at many very different skills and tasks from playing chess to writing or solving science puzzles, not equally of course. Some of us are experts in some fields and beginners and others, but we can technically do all of them. In the past AI was narrow and able to become a good at one skill, but was rather bad in all the others. Simply by building faster computers and pouring more money into AI training, we'll get us new, more powerful generations of AI. But what the next step for AI is to become a general intelligence like us, an AI. If the AI improvement process continues as it has been, it's not unlikely that AI could be better in most or even all skills that humans can do. We don't know how to build AI, how it will work, or what it will be able to do. Since narrow AI's today are capable of mastering one mental task quickly, H.I. might be able to do the same with all mental tasks. So, if it starts out stupid, an H.I. might be able to become a smart and capable as a human. While this sounds like science fiction, most AI researchers think this will happen sometime this century, may be already in a few years. Humanity is not ready for what will happen next, not socially, not economically, not morally. Earlier we defined intelligence as the ability to learn, reason, acquire knowledge and skills, and use them to solve problems, all things humans excel at. An H.I. is intelligent as even an average human would already disrupt modern civilization, because they're not bound by the same limitations as we are. Today's AI's like chatGBT already think and solve the tasks they were made for at least 10 times faster than even very skilled humans. Maybe H.I. will be slower, but it may also be faster, maybe much faster. And since H.I. is a software, you could copy them endlessly, as long as you have enough storage and run them in parallel. There are 8 million scientists in the world. Now imagine an H.I. copied a million times and put to work. Imagine one million scientists working 24-7 thinking 10 times faster than humans without being distracted, only focused on the task they've been given. What if suddenly H.I. could do all intelligence-based jobs in the world from interpreting law to coding to creating animated YouTube videos better faster and much cheaper than humans? Would whoever controls this H.I. suddenly own the economy? And thinking bigger, human progress is our intelligence applied to problems, so what could a million H.I.s achieve? So fundamental questions of science like dark energy invent new technology that gives us limit this energy, fix climate change, cure aging and cancer. But then again, sadly humans apply their intelligence not just for the benefit of all. What if the H.I.s a task to guide drones or call the triggers in war? Or to engineer a virus that only kills people with green eyes? Or to create the most profitable social media so addictive that people starve in front of their screens? The creation of H.I. could reasonably be as big of an event as taming fire or electricity and give whoever invents is equally as much power. But now let's go one step further. What if the potential of H.I. doesn't stop here? Intelligence, explosion. Intelligence and knowledge build and accelerate each other, but humans are limited by biology and evolution. Once we evolve the right hardware, our software outpaced evolution by orders of magnitude and within a heartbeat we roll this planet. But our software basically hasn't changed much since then, which is why we have a obesity and destroy the climate for short term gains. Since H.I.s software on a computer, once it's smart enough to do AI research, the rate of AI progress should speed up a lot. And that results in better AI that's better at AI research without much human involvement. It may even be possible that AI could learn how to directly improve itself in which case some experts fear this feedback loop could be incredibly fast. Maybe just months or years after the first self-improving H.I. is switched on. Maybe it would actually take decades. We simply don't know. This is all speculative. But such an intelligence explosion might lead to a true super intelligent entity. We don't know what such a being would look like, what its motives or goals would be, what would go on in its inner world. We could be as laugh at least Jupiter super intelligence as squirrels are to us. Unable to even comprehend its way of thinking. This hypothetical scenario keeps many people up at night. Humanity is the only example we have of an animal becoming smarter than all others, and we have not been kind to what we perceive as less intelligent beings. H.I. might be the last invention of humanity. It's possible that it could become the most intelligent and therefore most powerful being on earth. A. God in a box that could exercise its power to bring unimaginable wealth and happiness to humans while securing our future. Or it could subvert civilization and bring about our end with humanity unable to come up with a way to stop it. We'll look at some of these potential futures in more videos, but for now let's wrap up. The only thing we know for sure is that today right now, many of the largest and richest companies in the world are racing to create ever more powerful A.I.s. Whatever our future is, we are running towards it. Who knows how long we have until we must confront our A.I. future? Luckily, you still have plenty of time to prepare for us. If you're learning on brilliance, that is. Brilliant will make you a better thinker and problem-solver in just a minute, today. With thousands of bite-sized hands-on lessons on just about anything you may be curious about including A.I. Their latest course, how L.M.s work, takes you under the hood of real language models. It demystifies technologies like chatGBT with interactive lessons on everything from how models build vocabulary to how they choose their next words. You'll learn how to tune L.M.s to produce output with exactly your desired tonality, whether it's per tree or a cover letter. And you'll understand why training is really everything by comparing models trained on Taylor Swift lyrics and the legal speech of big text terms and conditions. It's an immersive A.I. workshop allowing you to experience and harness the mechanics of today's most advanced tool. We've also partnered with Brilliant to create a series of lessons to take your scientific knowledge to the next level. These lessons let you further explore the topics in almost more beautiful videos from rapes and mammalian metabolism to climate science and supernovae. Each lesson on Brilliant is interactive, like a one-on-one version of a course-cazatovileo. And you can get started whenever, wherever, right from whatever device you'd like. To get hands-on with course-cazatoch lessons and explore everything Brilliant has to offer, from A.I.I. and programming to maths, science and beyond, start your free 30-day trial by signingup at Brilliant.org slash nutshell. There's even an extra perk for course-cazatovures anyone's signing up through our link will get 20% off an annual membership once their trial ends.\",\n",

      " And what could happen? We can tell stories. And it's awesome. But if language is so good, why didn't any other animal develop it like we did? Start Time: 0:02:13 End Time: 0:02:26\n",

      " So, living in the safety of the trees was great. Those who stayed became the chimps we know today. Start Time: 0:02:53 End Time: 0:03:00\n",
      " But for reasons we're still not quite sure of, some of the chulcus decided to venture down to the Savannah. Start Time: 0:03:00 End Time: 0:03:07\n",
      " Without appropriate physical abilities, things like collaboration, imagining new strategies and the assigning of roles were necessary for survival. Start Time: 0:03:08 End Time: 0:03:17\n",
      " All of which are easier if you have a rich collection of symbols that can refer to things across time. Start Time: 0:03:17 End Time: 0:03:24\n",
      " Language. Many different types of creatures emerged with varying adaptations, but today only one member of the family remains us. Start Time: 0:03:24 End Time: 0:03:33\n",
      " Language as we know it may have been one of the strategies that kept us alive in the Savannah. Start Time: 0:03:34 End Time: 0:03:40\n",
      " But where did it move in? The brains of those who developed language and those who didn't aren't totally different. Start Time: 0:03:40 End Time: 0:03:48\n",
      " A brand new brain structure didn't just pop into existence. Start Time: 0:03:48 End Time: 0:03:52\n",
      " Instead, anatomy used for other tasks must have been sacrificed. Start Time: 0:03:52 End Time: 0:03:57\n",
      " And as it turns out, for beautiful reasons, detailed short-term memory may have been a fair thing to lose in return for language. Start Time: 0:03:57 End Time: 0:04:08\n",
      " This tradeoff between memory and language is the cognitive tradeoff hypothesis. Start Time: 0:04:08 End Time: 0:04:16\n",

      " What makes humans different from other animals? Well, one thing is language. We have the cognitive ability to communicate not just about what's happening now, but also about what did happen. Start Time: 0:01:51 End Time: 0:02:12\n",
      " And what could happen? We can tell stories. And it's awesome. But if language is so good, why didn't any other animal develop it like we did? Start Time: 0:02:13 End Time: 0:02:26\n",

      " But where did it move in? The brains of those who developed language and those who didn't aren't totally different. Start Time: 0:03:40 End Time: 0:03:48\n",
      " A brand new brain structure didn't just pop into existence. Start Time: 0:03:48 End Time: 0:03:52\n",
      " Instead, anatomy used for other tasks must have been sacrificed. Start Time: 0:03:52 End Time: 0:03:57\n",
      " And as it turns out, for beautiful reasons, detailed short-term memory may have been a fair thing to lose in return for language. Start Time: 0:03:57 End Time: 0:04:08\n",

      "**1. Introduction** [00:00:00-00:00:45]\n",
      "\n",
      "This document explores the fascinating topic of chimpanzee memory and its implications for understanding human language development.  The video introduces us to the Primate Research Institute in Inuyama, Japan, home to chimpanzees trained in memory games that reveal surprising differences between human and chimpanzee cognitive abilities.  As the video states, \"This is going to blow your mind\" [00:00:41]. The introduction sets the stage by demonstrating a numerical memory task that chimpanzees perform with remarkable ease compared to humans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. The Cognitive Trade-off Hypothesis** [00:01:31-00:04:16]\n",
      "\n",
      "The video proposes the theory that humans may be less proficient in certain memory tasks *because* of language. \"One theory is that we humans are worse at this task because we can talk.\" [00:01:31]. This leads to the introduction of the Cognitive Trade-off Hypothesis.  The hypothesis argues that the development of language in humans may have come at the expense of detailed short-term memory. This trade-off is explored through the evolutionary divergence of humans and chimpanzees from their last common ancestor, CHLCA (Chimpanzee Human Last Common Ancestor) [00:02:33].\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. The Primate Research Institute (PRI) and Dr. Matsuzawa** [00:04:23-00:07:19]\n",
      "\n",
      "This section introduces the Primate Research Institute (PRI) at Kyoto University and its founder, Dr. Tetsuro Matsuzawa.  Dr. Matsuzawa's decades-long research on non-human primates, particularly chimpanzees, provides the foundation for the Cognitive Trade-off Hypothesis. His work focuses on creating a naturalistic habitat for chimpanzees and utilizing computer-based cognitive tasks that mimic foraging behaviors. [00:06:02].\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. The Evolution of Language and Its Cost** [00:07:21-00:09:54]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Matsuzawa explains how environmental pressures faced by early humans venturing onto the savannah might have driven the development of language.  He posits that collaboration, strategic thinking, and role assignment – all facilitated by language – were crucial for survival in this new environment.  \"Our habitat provided a pressure to develop language. Yes, we have to collaborate each other.\" [00:08:09-00:08:15]  This, he suggests, led to a trade-off where the detailed short-term memory capabilities seen in chimpanzees were sacrificed for the development of language.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. The Cognitive Trade-Up Hypothesis** [00:09:54-00:10:45]\n",
      "\n",
      "The Cognitive Trade-up Hypothesis suggests that the ability to think abstractly, plan for the future, and communicate using symbolic language offered significant advantages to early humans, despite the loss of some memory capacity. \"I can think about the future of my child and their children. Yeah, chimpanzee do not have this kind of planning of the future.\" [00:10:18-00:10:23] This ability to \"share\" is highlighted as a defining characteristic of humans [00:11:08].\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. The Memory Challenge with Ai** [00:12:05-00:15:34]\n",
      "\n",
      "This section documents the memory test between the video presenter and Ai, an older chimpanzee.  The test involves remembering the location of numbers on a screen. The increasing difficulty of the test is described, and the results of the initial rounds are shared.\n",
      "\n",
      "**7.  The Unattempted Challenge with Ayumu** [00:15:34-00:16:27]\n",
      "\n",
      "The presenter expresses interest in competing against Ayumu, Ai's son and a renowned memory champion among the chimpanzees. However, Ayumu is not interested in participating on this occasion, highlighting the importance of free choice in Dr. Matsuzawa's research.\n",
      "\n",
      "**8.  Competing Against Ayumu's Times** [00:16:28-00:20:10]\n",
      "\n",
      "Unable to compete directly with Ayumu, the presenter instead takes on the memory test at Ayumu's speed. This proves to be incredibly difficult, illustrating the dramatic difference in short-term memory capacity.  The presenter's struggles highlight Ayumu's exceptional abilities.  \"It's impossible\" [00:19:49].\n",
      "\n",
      "**9. The Importance of Chimpanzee Research and Conservation** [00:20:13-00:22:05]\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr. Matsuzawa emphasizes the significance of continued chimpanzee research for understanding human evolution and the need for conservation efforts. \"Chimpanzees are classified endangered species so to pass those treasure to the next generation Now we have to do the action\" [00:20:27]. He stresses their importance as our closest evolutionary relatives and the insights they offer into human traits.\n",
      "\n",
      "**10. Conclusion** [00:21:35-00:22:05]\n",
      "\n",
      "The video concludes by reiterating that while human language is unique, it doesn't make humans inherently superior. Studying chimpanzees and other primates helps us understand our own evolutionary journey and underscores the importance of preserving these species for future generations. The loss of chimpanzees represents a loss of a crucial piece of our own story.\n",
